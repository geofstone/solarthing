# Config
This is the recommended directly for storing your configs.

By default, there are no files in this directory except this one.
## Setting up
To start, you should move the [base_template.json file](../../config_templates/base_template.json) here and name it `base.json`.

You can see template configs in the [config_templates](../../config_templates) directory and move them here.
