# json-datasource
Allows for data to be queried by Grafana using simple http requests.

This module will be good for things that are custom and cannot easily be queried by Flux or GraphQL.

### TODO
* Create another module that uses GraphQL to query. https://www.graphql-java.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-spring-boot/
