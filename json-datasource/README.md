# json-datasource
Allows for data to be queried by Grafana using simple http requests.

This module will be good for things that are custom and cannot easily be queried by Flux or GraphQL.

### TODO
* Actually implement logic to return annotations and metrics for SolarThing that Flux is unable to do
* Create another module that uses GraphQL to query. https://www.graphql-java.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-spring-boot/
