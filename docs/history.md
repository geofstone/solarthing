# History
This program started in the summer of 2017.

### Inspiration
@eidolon1138 is the one who originally came up with the idea to collect data from his Outback Mate device. He helped
set up the database and @retrodaredevil did the rest. Eventually @retrodaredevil created an android app making it much
more convenient than a website.

@retrodaredevil came up with the idea of the outhouse status when he walked all the way out to the outhouse only to find
that it was occupied! He walked all the way back inside, then went back out a few minutes later. He knew that something
had to be done about this first world problem.

### Legacy
[The perl script](../helloworld.pl) is a legacy program. It was the program that started solarthing.
After learning perl for a day. I went straight back to Java, which I am more familiar with.
