# GraphQL
This module contains a Spring Boot REST API that uses GraphQL to fetch SolarThing data from CouchDB.

This is work in progress

### How this works
This uses [GraphQL-SPQR](https://github.com/leangen/GraphQL-SPQR) to convert the SolarThing API to
a GraphQL Schema.

#### Useful Links
This is useful for querying: https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-playground
