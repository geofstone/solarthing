# Battery Charging
For FXs, charging is governed by the master FX (when stacked)

### Bulk
Constant current stage. Drives the battery voltage up

### Absorption (Absorb)
Constant voltage stage. Current varies as needed to maintain the voltage. Current typically decreases over time

### Float (Trickle charge)
Constant voltage stage. (Lower voltage than absorb) Current varies as needed to maintain the voltage. Current typically decreases to a low number

### Equalize (EQ)
Constant voltage stage.

---

EQ Voltage is the highest
Absorb Voltage is second highest
Float Voltage is third highest
