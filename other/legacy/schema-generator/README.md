# Schema Generator
Generates JSON Schema to be viewed in something like https://navneethg.github.io/jsonschemaviewer/

This requires Java 8 and uses https://github.com/mbknor/mbknor-jackson-jsonSchema

This is now legacy and is not used anymore

## Goal
The goal of this submodule is to eventually be able to display the JSON schema in a way
that makes creating queries easier and also makes it easier to write applications that don't use
this library but still use SolarThing data (such as the web application).
